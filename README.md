# IT493 - Senior Design Project I & II
Capstone is a transitional program engaging all previous education to solve typical business process challenges
where information technology may be part of the solution scenario. Senior Design Project II is significantly more work than
Senior Design Project I. In this course, the team effort turns from a research effort to that of “selling” the improvement to
their client, developing, and implementing a solution. The team provides evidence that their solution has improved one or
more business processes for their client. By the end of the semester, each team documents, trains, implements, and
demonstrates their solution.

Project: The Meat Pakt

Description: Our team worked with a local South Asian grocery business, Pak Bazaar, to develop and implement a solution for their lack of a website and efficient ordering system. The solution we developed included a new website built through WordPress and plugins with an online ordering system implemented with WooCommerce. Additional changes were made with CSS.
